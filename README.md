# Jupyter-Widgets-for-Data-Visualization-Tutorial

This repository is a tutorial for using Jupyter Widgets (ipywidgets) for creating interactive data visualizations. It showcases simple yet powerful implementations that one can use to enhance their interactive data visualization skillset within a Jupyter notebook. Each widget is paired with an explanation of what it is, the most simple implementation, and multiple potential use cases in data visualization along with one of those use cases implemented. There are also pro tips along the way that encourage or inform the reader of important data visualization techniques to create a better visualization. 

The widgets that are included in this tutorial are only a subset of the entire ipywidgets collection. The eight best widgets for interactive data visualizations in this tutorial are:

- CheckBox
- Dropdown
- RadioButtons
- ToggleButtons
- IntSlider
- IntRangeSlider
- FloatRangeSlider
- ColorPicker
